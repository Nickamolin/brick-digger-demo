### Summary
Dig as deep as you can! Brick Digger is a physics-based arcade game where you slingshot a bouncing ball into bricks of varying toughness. Destroying bricks scores points and unlocks deeper layers.

### Purpose
Built for the PICO-8 Game Quest in UVA’s CS 4730: Computer Game Design under the theme “Into the depths.” Grade: 100/100.

### Implementation
Developed on the PICO-8 fantasy console. Programmed the update & draw loop in Lua, writing the full game loop (collision physics, scoring, animation) from scratch. Sprites and SFX were created with PICO-8’s built-in editors.

### Skills Learned
 - Game Architecture: Implemented the full update/draw loop and structured core game state logic.

 - Physics & Collision Systems: Built custom bounce mechanics with friction, damping, and precise edge detection.

 - Difficulty Balancing & Game Feel: Tuned gameplay responsively through iterative playtesting and feedback.

 - Sprite & Sound Design: Created original visuals and audio using PICO-8’s built-in editors.

 - UI/UX Design: Communicated game states clearly through intuitive visual and interaction cues.

 - Effects & Animation Systems: Authored custom particle effects to enhance feedback and moment-to-moment impact.
